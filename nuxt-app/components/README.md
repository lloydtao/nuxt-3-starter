# Components Directory

The `components/` directory is where you put all your Vue components which can then be imported inside your pages or other components ([learn more](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html#components-basics)).

Nuxt automatically imports any components in your `components/` directory (along with components that are registered by any modules you may be using).
